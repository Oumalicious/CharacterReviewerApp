# VocabularyReviewerApp
A browser app with a 3-way column matching score system, built to practice memorizing languages that use characters.
As a Chinese Asian American, I'm embarrassed to call myself Chinese when I know very little of my language. I only speak it at home or amongst friends.
I have good fundamentals in tones and sentence structure, but my weakness lie in vocabulary. I remember going to Saturday school to learn Chinese,
reading paragraphs of characters with perfect eunciation, but I had know idea what I was saying. I studied for tests because I had the mindset of
"grades are important because it's a reflection of how smart you are." With this app that was initially built on a whim, I can slowly learn more vocabulary
at my own pace and occasionally review myself.

There are 3 unique assets of this app: double layered multiple choice, retesting wrong characters/question, and portability.
